AIM OF PROJECT:

 - Clone the top half of the yourdaye.com/box/
 - A carousel displaying each tampon, price and if coated with CBD. (Also if product is low something to show popularity)
 - If you click on a tampon, it will update a basket found in the top right of page.
 - Checkout component displays a dropdown box with buttons to add more tampons (this will update the basket)


WHAT I FOUND QUITE TRICKY:

- Turning the XML object into JSON

Would of done it differently but I wanted to get a solution out to you guys as soon as and thought this was the most effficient
way of displaying the data.

COULD OF DONE DIFFERENT:
- Gone with the original plan of a clone with a carousel displaying the tampons.
- Made the options for CBD and No CBD a dropdown menu, with a quantity of how many are in stock
- An Add button, to which increments a basket
- A hover animation over the basket to show how much they're total is and how many amounts they have



FEATURES I COULD OF ADDED:
- Rendering the image on each card had they been different images as this would of made the app more scalable if we wanted to 
  resuse the component (similar reason for currency)
- useContext/Redux to make the counter state update a basket as you increment the button.
- In the TamponCard, I would of added a description box highlighting why theres a price difference/ product description 
  had it been found in the object
